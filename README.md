The goal of this project is primarly to be able to give the rate between two currency by typing them in the console.</br>
The available pairs are : </br>
-EURCHF</br>
-EURGBP</br>
-EURUSD</br>
-USDCHF</br>
-USDEUR</br>
-USDGBP</br>

The application stores the pairs' rate everytime the users asks for the rate between the currencies.</br>
Then the information is still available by making a GET request at the URL : </br>
http://localhost:8124/rate
